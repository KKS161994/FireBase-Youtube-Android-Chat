# Firebase Chat Android Application

This application is essentially the clone of the Firebase Android Client application and has the added feature that you can type the name of any youtube video in your chat message inside  (()), eg - (("the doors: light my fire")) and you get the thumbnail to the top video given by youtube as a response to that search. Clicking the thumb nail allows you to see the video.
